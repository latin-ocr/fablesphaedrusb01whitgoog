which are formed from other Latin or Greek words ¹

respectively. ’ ¹

Moreover, as an acquaintance with the principles ’
ot Genuum, as well as with Euvuouocv‚ is
necessary to the understanding of a language, such
points of construction as seem to require elucida-
tion are concisely explained under the proper
articles, or a reference is simply made to that rule
in the Public Sebools Latin Primer, or in Porrss
Elementaey Greek Grammar, which meets the
particular difficulty. lt occasionally happens, how-
ever, that more information is needed than can be
gathered from the above-named works. When
such is the case, whatever is requisite is supplied,
in substance, from Jels's Greek Grammar, Winer’s
Grammar of New Tutanum Greek, or the Latin
Grammars ef Zumpt and Madvig
